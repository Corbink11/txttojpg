Information management tools like PIM systems will typically export JPG files as a .txt link to download the JPEG, since data is 
exported from these systems in CSV files. This can be annoying when having to use these images, since a link to download
the image, instead of having the image as a JPG, adds hours onto any tasks requiring large amounts of these images. 

This tool will iterate through any directory containing the links to these images in text form, and give them to you in a JPG so you can 
work with your images instead of a string of text. The script can also be modified slightly to read straight from a CSV instead of a directory.
